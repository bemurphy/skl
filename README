SYNOPSIS

    Generate skeleton projects from github repos

DESCRIPTION

    `skl`, short for 'skeleton' lets you use a github repo
    as a starting point for new projects.  The repo is cloned
    to create the file structure for your new project.

    This automates a few steps:

    1. Expand to a github repo url from the arguments
    2. Clone the project off of github into a new directory
    3. Start fresh by purging the .git and .gitconfig files

INSTALLATION

    A couple options:

    1. Copy/paste the skl file to a directory of your choosing.
    2. Clone the repo and symlink to skl/skl

    Then ensure `skl` is in your path.

USAGE

    You can provide a full git repo url, a github style user/name, or
    just a repo name.  If you only provide a repo name, it will find
    github.user in your gitconfig, so make sure that exists.

    Examples, from most to least verbose:

    $ skl git@github.com:bemurphy/app.git my_new_app_dir

    # or

    $ skl bemurphy/app my_new_app_dir

    # or

    $ skl app my_new_app_dir
